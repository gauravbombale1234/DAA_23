/*
Implement a problem of maximize Profit by trading
stocks based on given rate per day.
Statement: Given an array arr[] of N positive integers
which denotes the cost of selling and buying a stock on
each of the N days. The task is to find the maximum
profit that can be earned by buying a stock on or selling
all previously bought stocks on a particular day.
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 5} Output: 5
Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 1} Output: 0
